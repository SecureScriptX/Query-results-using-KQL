The where operator filters a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a predicate.

SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)

SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h) and EventID == "4624"

SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where EventID == 4624
| where AccountType =~ "user"

SecurityEvent | where EventID in (4624, 4625)
