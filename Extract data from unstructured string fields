Security log data is often contained in unstructured string fields and requires parsing to extract data. There are multiple ways of pulling information from string fields in KQL. The two primary operators used are extract and parse.

extract

Extract gets a match for a regular expression from a text string. You may optionally convert the extracted substring to the indicated type.

print extract("x=([0-9.]+)", 1, "hello x=45.6|wo") == "45.6"

parse

Parse evaluates a string expression and parses its value into one or more calculated columns. The computed columns will have nulls for unsuccessfully parsed strings.

Syntax

T | parse [kind=regex [flags=regex_flags] |simple|relaxed] Expression with * (StringConstant ColumnName [: ColumnType]) *

Returns

he input table extended according to the list of columns that are provided to the operator.

The following statement demonstrates the parse operator, which evaluates a string expression and parses its value into one or more calculated columns. Use for structuring unstructured data.
